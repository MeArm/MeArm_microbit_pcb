### Description

This handy control board breaks uses pins P13, P14, P15, and P16 for controlling servo motors to manipulate a 4 axis robot arm. Pins P0, P1, P2, and P3 are used for analog inputs.

Disabling the LED matrix using the [following code](https://makecode.microbit.org/_8JDe2RcyMcPF) allows us to gain this extra functionality, and also times out the servo motors when they are not in use.

6V power can be supplied through a centre positive 2.1mm barrel jack. USB power is available but not advised if you're planning on moving quickly.
